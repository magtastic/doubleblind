 *
 * A resolve is also the check-in PRODUCT.md talks about: every authenticated
 * call bumps `last_seen_at`, and a profile that has not checked in for ninety
 * days is `Gone` rather than `Unauthorized` — the difference matters to the
 * agent, which can republish rather than hunt for a lost token.
 *
 * Time comes from `Clock`, never from `now()` in SQL, so `TestClock` can walk a
 * profile over the expiry line.
